Smart Traffic Monitoring and Management System üö¶
This project implements a smart traffic monitoring system using ESP32, Flask, and a web dashboard.
It collects live traffic data using ultrasonic and IR sensors, processes it via a Python Flask API, and displays it through a responsive website.

üìÇ Project Structure
Part	Description
ESP32 Final.txt	Arduino code for ESP32 to collect traffic data from IR and ultrasonic sensors and send it to the server.
APP.py final code.txt	Python Flask API to receive sensor data and serve it to the frontend.
WEBSITE CODE FINAL.txt	Frontend website to display live traffic status dynamically.
‚öôÔ∏è Hardware Used
ESP32 Development Board

HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensors (for vehicle distance detection)

IR Sensors (for vehicle presence detection)

Traffic Lights (LEDs or real physical lights)

RTC Module (DS3231) (for timestamping data)

SIM800L GSM Module (optional: for remote connectivity)

Servo Motor (for barrier control)

ESP32-CAM (optional: for live video streaming)

üõ†Ô∏è Software Stack
Arduino IDE (for ESP32 programming)

Python Flask (for backend server)

HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for frontend website)

Firebase / ThingsBoard (optional: for IoT telemetry)

MQTT Protocol (for IoT communication)

üöÄ How It Works
ESP32 collects real-time traffic data using ultrasonic and IR sensors.

It sends the data via HTTP POST requests to the Flask server (APP.py).

The Flask server stores the latest traffic status and serves it through API endpoints.

The website fetches this data using JavaScript and updates the UI dynamically to show live traffic conditions.

üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project
1. Flash the ESP32
Open ESP32 Final.txt in Arduino IDE.

Connect your ESP32 board.

Upload the code after setting Wi-Fi SSID and Password.

2. Run the Flask Backend
bash
Copy
Edit
pip install flask
python "APP.py final code.txt"
Server will start at http://localhost:5000.

3. Host the Frontend Website
Open WEBSITE CODE FINAL.txt.

You can simply open it in a browser OR host it via a local server.

Example using Python:

bash
Copy
Edit
# For Python 3.x
python -m http.server 5000
Access the website at http://localhost:5000.

Make sure the website's JavaScript fetch URL matches the Flask server address.

üì° API Endpoints
Method	Endpoint	Description
POST	/trafficdata	Receive traffic sensor data from ESP32
GET	/	Serve basic website response (optional)
üì∏ Optional Features
ESP32-CAM Streaming: Set up live video feed from the traffic site.

Firebase Integration: Push live telemetry data to cloud.

MQTT Communication: Use ThingsBoard for IoT dashboards.

üõ°Ô∏è Future Improvements
Add vehicle counting with more complex algorithms.

Implement AI-based traffic congestion prediction.

Introduce barrier control automation.

Add a proper login system for admin access.
